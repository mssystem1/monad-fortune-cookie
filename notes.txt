1) analyze full workspace and smart contract code. 
2) Need to add new feature in project: generate image from text with OpenAI then mint this image. 
We will use Pinata for storage.
need to add separate button Generate Image with AI (from topic/hint), separate card to show image (shoulde be able to make it bigger to see), button Mint this Image.
3) need to add beautiful header - Monad Fortune Cookies.
4) need to add 2 separate columns in leaderboard: Minted Cookies (), Minted Images ().
read getTextMinters from smart contract to get addresses for Minted Cookies
read getImageMinters from smart contract to get addresses for Minted Images.
then fill these 2 columns with how much Minted Cookies and Minted Images for wallet address, which i get from blockvision endpoints: 
const BV_HOLDERS  = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/collection/holders";
const BV_HOLDINGS = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/account/nft/holdings";


1) leaderboardclientUI does not receive mintedCookies and mintedImages so in leaderboard they 0. Maybe route.ts from leaderboard does not return values.
 need to fix.
2) I do not see in the card Generate with AI and Mint - save to pinata, preview card, Simple zoom modal, Mint this Image, mint button.
3) need to reed mintprice from smart contract and use this value in onMint function: mintWithFortune function and mintWithImage function.
need to fix. check screen
4) need to update quiries for Last minted and All minted to this wallet: lastMintQ and holdingsQ - maybe better to check in https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/token/0xBdB861cdfcAE8aC7B5DC95000EE487224BD89E54?tab=Holder or use blockvision endpoints const BV_HOLDERS  = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/collection/holders";
const BV_HOLDINGS = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/account/nft/holdings".
need to fix.
cause there are lots of errors. check har file and console logs for error.
5) fix error: OpenAI error: 400 Unknown parameter: 'response_format' when call generate image with AI.
6) i think better to remove privy cause i get this error: origins don't match "https://auth.privy.io" "http://localhost:3000"
show what, where and how modify in project attached.

actually src/app/api/leaderboard/route.ts is very different from mine, so this code will destroy existing function. based on my code show me what, where and how change.

also your src/app/leaderboard/ui/LeaderboardClient.tsx destroys existing logic. based on my code show me what, where and how chnage or add in this file

how /api/holdings/route.ts are tied with page.tsx and Last minted and All minted to this wallet on that?

1) remove purple line and add my logo (uploaded) in header need to update:
          <div style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(90deg,#111,#1d0b2f 40%,#111)', borderBottom: '1px solid #2a2a2e' }}>
            <div style={{ maxWidth: 1280, margin: '0 auto', padding: '20px 16px' }}>
              <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'baseline', gap: 12 }}>
                <div style={{ fontSize: 28, fontWeight: 900, letterSpacing: '-0.02em', color: '#fff' }}>
                  Monad Fortune Cookies
                </div>
                <div style={{
                  height: 2, width: 120,
                  background: 'linear-gradient(90deg,#7c3aed,#a855f7)',
                  borderRadius: 999
                }}/>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
2) need to replace status card on right after {/* Image generation + mint */} card, because now it is invisible
3) why CSS and styles confused, so input label of Topic / Hint is on preview. need to fix
4) after pressing generate image with ai got error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
5) Last minted and All minted to this wallet still does not work on page.tsx. I think holdings are not tied with /api/holdings/route.ts.
 last minted does not work cause it always shows wrong data and there are errors in console. need to remove existing function  with new:
need to update quiries for Last minted: lastMintQ - maybe better to check in https://testnet.monadexplorer.com/token/0xBdB861cdfcAE8aC7B5DC95000EE487224BD89E54?tab=Holder or use blockvision endpoints const BV_HOLDERS  = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/collection/holders";
const BV_HOLDINGS = "https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/account/nft/holdings".
need to fix.
6) http://localhost:3000/api/holdings?address=0xA7d827622c4F9c884cA8F751b2060DD767F18683&contract=0xBdB861cdfcAE8aC7B5DC95000EE487224BD89E54 always returns 
{"tokenIds":[],"note":"bv"}, but there already 5 minted NFTs. need to fix it

1) actually order now is like in 2, but it does not help. check the code and screenshot and provide real fix
3) fix in 3 did not help, so input label of Topic / Hint in Generate Image with AI is still overlaping preview. Need to fix CSS there. 
4) logo is not loaded. check screenshot
5 and 6) - you are wrong cause page.tsx used wrong functions for holdings and last minted. page.tsx does not use src/app/api/holdings/route.ts

1) generate image with ai does not work. get error. check console log
2) status card should be in centre between Generate Image with AI and Generate Fortune. now it is below. check screenshot and fix.
3) .col { min-width: 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 8px; } did not help, so input label of Topic / Hint in Generate Image with AI is overlapping now
Generate Image with AI card border
4) why you do not listen to me dolboeb?  holdings and last minted on page.tsx does not work. stop telling me bullshit. check console logs and har file. provide fixes.
http://localhost:3000/api/holdings?address=0xA7d827622c4F9c884cA8F751b2060DD767F18683&contract=0xBdB861cdfcAE8aC7B5DC95000EE487224BD89E54 always returns
{"tokenIds":[],"note":"bv"}. it means it returns nothing.
Last minted showing wrong non existing NFT ID.
5) in leaderboard MINTED COOKIES and MINTED IMAGES shows 0, but there are 5 NFTS in total

1) generate image with ai does not work. get error. check console log
2) input label of Topic / Hint in Generate Image with AI is overlapping now
Generate Image with AI card border. maybe need to adjust in style jsx
        .two-col {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr);
          gap: 14px;
        }
        .two-col .input {
          display: block;
          width: 100%;
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
3) you are wrong again dolboeb. MINTED COOKIES / MINTED IMAGES cannot be read from countHoldingsInCollection.  it is used for different purpose
for MINTED COOKIES / MINTED IMAGES call smart contract functions function getTextMinters() and function getImageMinters() it returns address, every address - one minted NFT.
